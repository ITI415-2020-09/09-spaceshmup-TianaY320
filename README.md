# Space-SHMUP
The changes that I made are:
I changed the speed for Enemy 3 and 4 because I think that they move too fast

changed the scores for all of the enemies based off of their difficulty

changed the chances of a powerup dropping for each enemy based off of their diffuculty of 
hitting them

I added a scorecounter and highscore keeper
I also added a timer so it adds more agency to the game
Also since this has more of an arcade feel, I wanted to add seconds to the timer 
if they destroyed an enemy
